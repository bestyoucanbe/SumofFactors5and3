# SumofFactors5and3

To keep my coding skills fresh, I started working on Codewar challenges.  This is the first one completed with a solution that passed all their tests after the code was written.  I feel happy!

I was also humbled when I saw how many different ways that this solution could have been implemented!!!  The good news--My solution is rather straightforward to understand and implement!  The other good news--There are other ways to understand the problem and implement a solution that may be even be simpler but may need more knowledge of mathematics.
